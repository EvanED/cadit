# `cadit` Editor

`cadit` is a simple text editor for a narrow use case -- I wanted something I could replace my use of `cat > file.txt` with.

It is still in its very early stages -- a little buggy, feature-incomplete, and with a code base that was cobbled together without regard to anything fancy like "design" or "taste."

# Use

Run `cadit > file.txt`. That's about it for now.

There's no way to read a file as input, or save it other than redirect the output.
